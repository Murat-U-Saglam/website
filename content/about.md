### Machine learning enthusiast, Cyber Security enjoyer and professional automater.

As you might of guessed from the tittle, I am a fan of Mr Robot. Apart from being an amazing show, with oustanding visuals and audio, the plot is very interesting. The concept of a small talented group having the ability to bring down an ""establishment" has always appealed to me. I guess it is a bastardised version of the American Dream. Regardless it was mainly because of this show, and other stuff I pursued cyber security at University, it was within the first month I realised that it isn't as trivial to replicate the plot. 


Coming to the realisation that taking over a country and ruining it's economy is too much effort. I was introduced to more cyber resillient systems, Peer to Peer networks, Distributed computation and more. This is where I was properly introduced into blockchain technologies. Understanding this system may be a lot more prominenent in the future made even more doubtful of viability of Mr Robot V2, regardless it's a good TV show I recommend that you should definently watch it (you've already stumpled on this page).
